# üç∑ Aged to Perfection: Red Wine Analytics

The most popular type of wine globally, red wine‚Äôs popularity stretches as far back as the sandy deltas of Ancient Egypt. Data gathered from Kaggle in creating this report, aims to give a detailed overview on red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

## üç∑ Data Visualization: Heat Map

Heat Maps visualizes the correlation matrix of selected columns in our dataset. The heatmap ranges from 1 to -1, indicating high correlation and low correlation respectively. For instance, desinty and fixed acidity are highly correlated indicated by their maxtrix value. Based on the negative values generated for pH and fixed acidity, we learn that theyre values have no correlation at all.

## üç∑ Data Visualization: Line Graph

This line graph shows the relationship between the Wine Density and pH. The density peaks when the pH level is 3 which indicates acidity. The further proves that high correlation they demostrated from the Heat Map.

## üç∑ Data Visualization: Bar Graph - Feature Importance

In Tree-Based Models (like Random Forest), feature importance is calculated based on the reduction in impurity (e.g., Gini impurity or entropy) when the feature is used to split data in decision trees. Features that result in larger reductions in impurity are considered more important. 
In General: 
- High importance: Features that significantly influence the target variable.
- Low importance: Features that have little to no influence on predictions.
